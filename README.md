# Guide_bot
This is a telegram bot developed by me specifically for my school-"International House-Tashkent". At the beginning of my last year of study, I wanted to leave something behind, something for which I will be remembered and for me it's something like <b>"Thank you, my school. Thank you, my teachers."</b>

Functions of this bot: 
1) Providing information about each teacher in the school. 
2)Presentation of the latest schedule in a convenient mode. 
3) Familiarization with the social life of the lyceum for those wishing to enroll. 
4) Issuance of the location of offices in the building.  Link to the bot in the telegram: https://t.me/https://t.me/Guide_IHT_bot
